<b>Introduction to DHTML:</b><br><br>
DHTML stands for Dynamic HTML, it is totally different from HTML. The browsers which support the dynamic HTML are some of the versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer of version higher than 4.0. The DHTML is based on the properties of the HTML, javascript, CSS, and DOM(Document Object Model which is used to access individual elements of a document) which helps in making dynamic content. It is the combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and DOM.<br><br>
<b>Key Features:</b> Following are the some major key features of DHTML:<br>
<ol>
<li>Tags and their properties can be changed using DHTML.<br></li>
<li>It is used for real-time positioning.<br></li>
<li>Dynamic fonts can be generated using DHTML.<br></li>
<li>It is also used for data binding.</li>
</ol>

<b>Why Use DHTML?</b><br>
<ul><li>
DHTML makes a webpage dynamic but Javascript also does, the question arises that what different does DHTML do? So the answer is that DHTML has the ability to change a webpages look, content and style once the document has loaded on our demand without changing or deleting everything already existing on the browserâ€™s webpage. DHTML can change the content of a webpage on demand without the browser having to erase everything else, i.e. being able to alter changes on a webpage even after the document has completely loaded.</p>
